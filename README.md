# Click-Through Rate Prediction Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at improving Click-Through Rate (CTR) predictions using machine learning techniques. The project uses R for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling, with results documented in a detailed HTML report.

## Project Overview

The objectives of this project are:
- Preprocessing data to handle missing values and optimize feature selection.
- Building a predictive model using `xgboost` with hyperparameter tuning.
- Documenting findings and insights in a well-structured HTML report.

## Repository Contents

- **`PACReport.html`**: An interactive HTML report summarizing the analysis, methods, and results of the project.
- **R Scripts and Data**: Supporting R scripts (e.g., `attempt15.R`) for model training and data manipulation.
- **`submission15_haeun.csv`**: Predicted CTR values generated from the scoring dataset.
